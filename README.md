# Wildlife Image Processing & Semantic Search System

The **Wildlife Image Processing & Semantic Search System** is a prototype platform for organizing, identifying, and exploring wildlife imagery using modern AI models, geospatial analysis, and semantic search.

This project combines computer vision, location data, and embeddings to assist wildlife enthusiasts, researchers, and photographers in documenting species, discovering patterns, and building richer digital field notes.
